# Shallow Neural Networks

## Problem 3.1:
## Problem 3.1:
If the activation function is $a[z] = \psi_{0} + \psi_{1}z$, the mapping from input to output just the line with y-intercept is $\psi_{0}$ and slope is $\psi_{1}$. Next, if the activation function is $a[z] = z$, the mapping from input to output just the line with y-intercept equal $0$ and slope is $1$. Both activation functions just an affine mapping, which means no nonlinearity is introduced to the network.
